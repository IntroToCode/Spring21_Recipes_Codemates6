# Super Spectacular Salad

## Servings: 5


## Time to prepare: 40-50 mins


## Ingredients:
Cucumbers
Tomatoes
Bell Pepper
Red Onion
Olives
Feta

## Equipment needed:
Bowl

## Steps for preparation:
Once you’ve got your ingredients ready, it’s as simple as slicing and dicing them to about the same size. And large chunks are preferred over a fine dice. Then, drizzle your salad with a Greek salad dressing and give it a gentle toss.


### Notes:
Pro Tip: Slice a few pieces of bread (sourdough or focaccia), lather in butter, cheese, and a bit of minced garlic. Broil in the oven for just a few minutes and then enjoy!
